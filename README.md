*   **`public/`**: Contains static assets that are served directly by the web server. This includes images, favicons, and `robots.txt`.
*   **`supabase/`**: Holds all Supabase-related configurations.
    *   `migrations/`: Contains SQL files that define the database schema and its evolution over time. This is crucial for setting up and maintaining the database structure.
    *   `config.toml`: Supabase project-specific configuration, like the project ID.
*   **`src/`**: This is where the core frontend application code resides.
    *   `components/`: Contains all React components. These are further organized into subdirectories:
        *   `admin/`: Components used exclusively in the admin section.
        *   `dashboard/`: Components for the user dashboard.
        *   `ui/`: Base UI components, often from shadcn-ui, like buttons, inputs, cards, etc.
    *   `contexts/`: For React Context API implementations, used for global state management (e.g., `AuthContext` for authentication state).
    *   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks to encapsulate reusable logic.
    *   `integrations/`: Modules for connecting to and interacting with external services.
        *   `supabase/`: Contains the Supabase client initialization and any related type definitions.
    *   `lib/`: Utility functions and helper modules (e.g., `utils.ts`).
    *   `pages/`: Components that represent entire pages or views of the application, mapped to specific routes (e.g., `Dashboard.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`).
    *   `App.tsx`: The root component of the React application. It typically sets up routing and global providers.
    *   `main.tsx`: The main entry point that renders the React application into the DOM.
    *   `index.css`: Global stylesheets or imports for base styles.
*   **Configuration Files**: The root directory also contains various configuration files for tools like Vite (`vite.config.ts`), TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`), ESLint (`.eslintrc.js`), Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.ts`), PostCSS (`postcss.config.js`), and package management (`package.json`).
*   **Documentation**:
    *   `USER_MANUAL.md`: A comprehensive guide for end-users and administrators.
    *   `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md`: A detailed report on the system's architecture, design, and security.

## Technical Setup

This section guides you through setting up the project for local development.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. We recommend using a Node Version Manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage Node.js versions (current LTS version is recommended).
*   **npm (or Bun):** npm is included with Node.js. This project can also be used with [Bun](https://bun.sh/). Examples will primarily use npm.

### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME>
    ```
    Replace `<YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>` with the actual URL of this repository and `<YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME>` with the name of the directory you want to clone into.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Alternatively, using Bun:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

### Environment Variables

The application requires Supabase credentials to connect to the backend.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can copy `.env.example` if it exists, or create the `.env` file manually.
    ```bash
    # cp .env.example .env  # If .env.example exists
    ```

2.  Populate the `.env` file with your Supabase project URL and Anon key:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-project-url"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"
    ```
    You can find these in your Supabase project's "API" settings page (Project Settings > API).

### Supabase Backend Setup

This project uses Supabase for its backend (database, authentication, APIs).

*   **Using an Existing Supabase Project:** If you are connecting to an already hosted Supabase project, ensure the environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) in your `.env` file are correctly set up with your project's credentials. The database schema should match the one defined in `supabase/migrations/`.

*   **Local Supabase Development (Optional but Recommended for Backend Changes):**
    If you plan to make changes to the database schema or test backend features locally, you'll need to use the Supabase CLI.
    1.  **Install Supabase CLI:** Follow the instructions on the [official Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started).
    2.  **Log in to Supabase CLI:**
        ```bash
        supabase login
        ```
    3.  **Link your project (if using a remote Supabase project as a base for local dev):**
        Navigate to the project root (or the `supabase` directory) and link your Supabase project. The `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` can be found in your Supabase project's dashboard URL (e.g., `https://app.supabase.com/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`) or in `supabase/config.toml`.
        ```bash
        supabase link --project-ref <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
        ```
        If you are starting a new local Supabase setup from scratch without linking to a remote project:
        ```bash
        supabase init
        ```
    4.  **Start local Supabase services:**
        ```bash
        supabase start
        ```
        This will spin up local Supabase services (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, etc.) in Docker containers. The local Supabase URL and anon key will be provided in the CLI output, which you should use in your `.env` file for local development.
    5.  **Apply Migrations:** To set up the database schema locally after starting Supabase:
        ```bash
        supabase db reset
        ```
        This command resets the local database and applies all migrations from the `supabase/migrations` folder.
    For more detailed information on Supabase CLI usage, refer to the [Supabase CLI documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).

### Running the Development Server

Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are set:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Or with Bun:
```bash
bun run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:8080` (as configured in `vite.config.ts`). The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
Or with Bun:
```bash
bun run build
```
The build artifacts will be placed in the `dist/` directory. This directory can then be deployed to any static site hosting service.
